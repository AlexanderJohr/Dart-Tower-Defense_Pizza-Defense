Dart-Tower-Defense_Pizza-Defense
================================

Pizza Defense is a tower defense game programmed in Google Dart, a new programming language for the web.

See the online demo: 



In a team of 4 members the game was first programmed in Java in 24 hours at the codecamp in Wernigerode. It was an exam for the students from the Harz University of Applied Sciences which takes place in an indoor swimming pool.

The Google Dart language makes it possible to program with classes as one would do with Java. I begun learning Google Dart with this project. In my opinion porting the whole Java code to Google Dart is the fastes way possible, to learn this new language, because both languages are so similar to each other. It took me 2 days until every class of Java code was translated to the corresponding Google Dart class.

Images where displayed within a Processing applet in the Java application. In Google Dart it is the HTML5-Canvas element, where all images are drawn.

It is possible to convert the Google Dart code to javascript, which makes the application runable on all modern browsers, even for smartphones.
